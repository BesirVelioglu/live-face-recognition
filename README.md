# Live Face Recognition Using DeepFace and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a live face recognition system using a webcam. The system captures video frames from the webcam and compares each frame with a reference image to determine if the faces match.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- DeepFace
- threading

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python-headless deepface
    ```

2. Clone this repository or download the files.

3. Replace the `reference.jpg` file with the image you want to use as the reference for face matching.

## Usage

Run the script to start the live face recognition system:
```bash
python live_face_recognition.py
```
